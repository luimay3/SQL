--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--A table was then created to insert Spotify data into. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Selecting all data to see what it pulls up
SELECT * FROM Spotifydata;

--Selecting the top 10 popular artists and their tracks
SELECT artist_name, popularity, track_id
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity
LIMIT 10;

--Selecting a specific artist and their tracks
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat';

--Selecting artists with more than 2 songs
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) as total_songs
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name HAVING COUNT(artist_name) >= 2
ORDER BY total_songs;

--Using CTE to select artists with an average popularity of 90 or more 
WITH tempTable AS (
  SELECT
  artist_name, AVG(popularity) as avg_pop 
  FROM Spotifydata
  GROUP BY artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name as TopStar, avg_pop 
From tempTable
WHERE avg_pop >= 90
